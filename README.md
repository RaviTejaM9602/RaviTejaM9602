## About Me
- I’m interested in web designing and :desktop_computer: developing an app. I love creating, designing and one day I will definitely create a website and/or application that everyone will use like Instagram 🦾!
- :+1: I have very active internal mental processes, and confident individualism. I'm an INFJ; which means that I'm very creative, insightful, principled, passionate, and altruistic. I like to consider things thoughtfully before acting so that I can commit my energy confidently to a course of action. I’m a creative thinker who likes to entertain a wide range of possibilities. I like to focus on the facts whenever possible and let objective information guide my decisions and actions. I like  to stay organised and plan things out so that I can focus my energy on priorities.
- :slightly_smiling_face: Through Microverse, I've learned to love collaboration; which we practised through remote pair programming. I found working in teams and solving challenges in groups to be very productive, insightful and challenging.
&nbsp;
 - I'm currently available for hire or open to new job opportunities.
